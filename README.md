# Kezbot
Kezbot (or [Shifty](https://t.me/Kezbot) on Telegram) is a modular Python Telegram bot that helps you find Spotify/Youtube songs based on the Youtube/Spotify url you sent to it. It basically gives you a different link of the song you send to the bot.

# What can this bot do?
1. Give you a Spotify url from a Youtube url you send to the bot.
2. Give you a Youtube url from a Spotify url you send to the bot.
3. Give you a top10 list of playlists for a certain searchterm.
4. Give you your Telegram-ID.

# Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome. I still want to add features for other platforms (Deezer, Soundcloud, Google Play Music, etc)
- contributions in the form of a pull-request have to be well-described for me to understand what you want.

# NOTE
I'm highly against piracy and illegal music downloading. Contributions containing such features will completely be ignored and future contributions by you will also be ignored.
