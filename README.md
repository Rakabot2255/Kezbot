# Kezbot
A Telegram bot that provides Spotify-URLs from Youtube-URLs

- Youtube titles without a hyphen (-) will give no results.
A Youtube video title MUST in every case have a hyphen between the Artist and the Title of a video.
- If a track is simply missing on Spotify the bot will reply with a message that it couldn't find that song.
- Any kind of Youtube-URL will work (youtube.com?watch=v, youtu.be/v, youtu.be/, youtube.com/embed/, etc)
- If a Youtube title includes parentheses containing the words 'remix' or 'edit' it will search for that
particular remix or edit. If there's something else between parentheses the parentheses including that text will be
removed to widen search.
